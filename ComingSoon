inDAGO - coming soon

A graphical user interface for both dual and bulk RNA-seq.

inDAGO will be presumably released in the 2025!

Transcriptomics studies of host-parasite interactions present significant challenges, particularly when the contact region between the two interacting organisms is difficult to isolate. Dual RNA-seq analysis offers a powerful alternative by allowing researchers to separate mixed transcripts in silico, providing a comprehensive view of transcriptome reprogramming in both host and parasite during infection. However, many existing pipelines for dual RNA-seq require a strong understanding of programming languages, as they are often distributed with command line interfaces in R or Linux environments. This creates a barrier for researchers without a programming background, highlighting the growing need for user-friendly software that can make these analyses more accessible to a broader scientific audience. Here, we introduce inDAGO, an open-source, cross-platform graphical user interface designed for dual RNA-seq analysis, offering two distinct approaches: sequential and combined. Built on the R Shiny framework, inDAGO is organized into modular components, the best available software for data processing alongside custom-developed R scripts for specific steps. Additionally, inDAGO includes a module for traditional bulk RNA-seq analysis. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, catering to researchers with varying levels of technical expertise, without compromising on the precision and flexibility needed for complex analyses. Users can easily customize a wide range of parameters to tailor the analysis to their specific dataset. Ultimately, inDAGO guides users through the entire process - from initial data input to to the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) -while providing intermediate result and publication-ready outputs at the conclusion of each module.
